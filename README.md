# Network Security Assessment Tool

A network security assessment tool designed to automate network scanning, identify vulnerabilities, and enhance network security. The tool utilizes the powerful Nmap scanning engine, integrates with vulnerability databases, and incorporates multithreading for parallel execution.

## Features

- Target Scanning: Perform network scans to identify live hosts and gather basic information about the network.
- Port Scanning: Scan open ports on target hosts, detect services running on those ports, and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports with scan results, including host information, open ports, and associated services.
- Multithreading: Leverage parallel processing to improve scanning speed and efficiency.
- User-Friendly Interface: Access the tool through a GUI or web-based interface for easy configuration and result management.

## Future Aspirations

- Real-Time Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring capabilities to detect changes in the network environment and provide instant alerts for potential security threats.
- Automation and Scheduling: Enable automated scans at predefined intervals, integrate with other systems through APIs, and schedule reports for regular delivery.
- Network Visualization: Visualize the network topology, display scan results on interactive maps, and provide intuitive representations of network vulnerabilities.
- Compliance and Regulatory Support: Enhance the tool to include checks and reporting mechanisms for compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Integration with Incident Response Systems: Integrate with ticketing or incident response systems to automatically generate tickets or incidents for identified vulnerabilities.
- Continuous Improvements: Continuously enhance the tool's functionality, performance, and security based on user feedback and emerging industry trends.
